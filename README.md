# PySOC
I: code and tutorial:

a. code: pysoc.tar.gz; short tutorial: pysoc.pdf 
b. Even more better tutorial written in Chinese by Lu Tian:http://bbs.keinsci.com/thread-9442-1-1.html
c. For Gaussian 16:http://bbs.keinsci.com/thread-19813-1-1.html

II: Basic Features for PySOC:  

a. evaluation of spin-orbit coupling elements between singlet and triplet states  
b. Python scripts + FORTRAN  
c. interfaced to third-party quantum chemistry packages, such as Gaussian 09 and DFTB+  
d. based on Casida’s wave functions in LR-TDDFT, TDA, TDDFTB  
e. Breit-Pauli spin-orbit Hamiltonian with effective charge approximation

IV: Note for MolSOC:  
(code: molsoc.tar.gz)  
   atomic integrals in PySOC are calculated from MolSOC code developed by Sandro Giuseppe Chiodo et al.
