a. evaluation of spin-orbit coupling elements between singlet and triplet states  
b. Python scripts + FORTRAN  
c. interfaced to third-party quantum chemistry packages, such as Gaussian 09 and DFTB+  
d. based on Casida’s wave functions in LR-TDDFT, TDA, TDDFTB  
e. Breit-Pauli spin-orbit Hamiltonian with effective charge approximation
