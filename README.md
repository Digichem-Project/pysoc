# PySOC

Basic Features for PySOC:  
(code: pysoc.tar.gz; short tutorial: pysoc.pdf)  

a. evaluation of spin-orbit coupling elements between singlet and triplet states  
b. Python scripts + FORTRAN  
c. interfaced to third-party quantum chemistry packages, such as Gaussian 09 and DFTB+  
d. based on Casida’s wave functions in LR-TDDFT, TDA, TDDFTB  
d. Breit-Pauli spin-orbit Hamiltonian with effective charge approximation

Note for MolSOC:  
(code: molsoc.tar.gz)  
   atomic integrals in PySOC are calculated from MolSOC code developed by Sandro Giuseppe Chiodo et al.
